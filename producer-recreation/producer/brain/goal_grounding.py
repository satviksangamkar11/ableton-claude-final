"""16.5.61: Goal Grounding — compare goal to world state.

Takes GoalModel + WorldModel → identifies gaps, contradictions, satisfactions.

Gap types:

  SATISFIED
    The goal's characteristic is already met in the world state.
    Example: goal requires "dark" and measured_characteristics.brightness is low.

  MISSING
    The goal requires a characteristic, but the world state has no evidence for it.
    Planner should find a capability that provides it.
    Example: goal requires "punchy" but attack_speed is not measured.

  CONTRADICTORY
    The goal's characteristic conflicts with current state.
    Example: goal requires "bright" but brightness is currently low.
    May require reversal of a prior change.

  CONSTRAINED
    The goal requires a characteristic, but available capabilities are blocked
    by prerequisites or limitations.
    Example: goal requires "longer sustain" but "no MCP mapping for Env1.Sustain"
    is in unresolved_limitations.

  UNGROUNDED
    The goal requires a characteristic, but evidence provides no capability.
    This is a discovery request.
    Example: goal requires "subtle warble" but no capability maps to that.
