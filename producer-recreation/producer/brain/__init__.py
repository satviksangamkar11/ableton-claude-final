"""16.5.61: Producer World Model + Goal Planner.

Sits above the compiler/capability infrastructure to add strategic reasoning:

    User Intent
        ↓ (Goal Parser)
    GoalModel (structured musical objective, no parameters)
        ↓ (Planner reads)
    WorldModel (current state: sections, roles, capabilities)
        ↓ (Gap Analysis)
    GoalGrounding (satisfied/missing/contradictory/constrained/ungrounded)
        ↓ (Planner decides)
    Plan (intentional actions, not raw MCP calls)
        ↓ (Executor)
    Measurement / Evaluation
        ↓ (Feedback to Planner)

Modules:
  - goal_model: GoalModel (user intent → structured musical objectives)
  - world_model: WorldModel (current state snapshot)
  - goal_grounding: GoalGroundingResult (goal vs. state gap analysis)
  - planner: ProductionPlan (goal + gaps + capabilities → actions)

INVARIANTS:
  1. No Serum parameters in GoalModel or Plan inputs
  2. WorldModel is read-only (updated externally)
  3. Gap types are closed enum (SATISFIED, MISSING, CONTRADICTORY, CONSTRAINED, UNGROUNDED)
  4. Planner output is intentional (e.g., "increase_bass_brightness") not tactical (e.g., "set Filter1Freq to 0.5")
